    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on implementation of three reqularisaion techniques, two of them are norm based approaches which are added to optimised objective and the third technique, called *droput*, is a form of noise injection by random corruption of information carried by hidden units during training.\n",

    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you proceed onwards, remember to activate your virtual environment:\n",
    "   * If you were in last week's Tuesday or Wednesday group type `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "   * If you were in the Monday group:\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **comfy** way type: `workon mlpractical`\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **generic** way, `source` your virutal environment using `source` and specyfing the path to the activate script (you need to localise it yourself, there were not any general recommendations w.r.t dir structure and people have installed it in different places, usually somewhere in the home directories. If you cannot easily find it by yourself, use something like: `find . -iname activate` ):\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syncing the git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a> for more details. But in short, we recommend to create a separate branch for this lab, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the mlpractical directory `cd ~/mlpractical/repo-mlp`\n",
    "2. List the branches and check which is currently active by typing: `git branch`\n",
    "3. If you have followed our recommendations, you should be in the `coursework1` branch, please commit your local changed to the repo index by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -am \"finished coursework\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Now you can switch to `master` branch by typing: \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    " ```\n",
    "5. To update the repository (note, assuming master does not have any conflicts), if there are some, have a look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. And now, create the new branch & swith to it by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b lab4\n",

    "# Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation add some *complexity term* to the cost function. It's purpose is to put some prior on the model's parameters. The most common prior is perhaps the one which assumes smoother solutions (the one which are not able to fit training data too well) are better as they are more likely to better generalise to unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A way to incorporate such prior in the model is to add some term that penalise certain configurations of the parameters -- either from growing too large ($L_2$) or the one that prefers solution that could be modelled with less parameters ($L_1$), hence encouraging some parameters to become 0. One can, of course, combine many such priors when optimising the model, however, in the lab we shall use $L_1$ and/or $L_2$ priors.\n",

We ignore here edge scenarios where $p^l_d=1$ and there is no dropout applied (and the training would be exactly the same as in standard SGD) and $p^l_d=0$ where all units would have been dropped, hence the model would not learn anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $p^l_d$ is a hyperparameter (like learning rate) meaning it needs to be provided before training and also very often tuned for the given task. As the notation suggest, it can be specified separately for each layer, including scenario where $l=0$ when some random input features (pixels in the image for MNIST) are being also ommitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keeping the $l$-th layer output $\\mathbf{\\hat h}^l$ (input to the upper layer) appropiately scaled at test-time\n",
    "\n",
    "The other issue one needs to take into account is the mismatch that arises between training and test (runtime) stages when dropout is applied. It is due to the fact that droput is not applied when testing hence the average input to the unit in upper layer is going to be bigger when compared to training stage (where some inputs are set to 0), in average $1/p^l_d$ times bigger. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to account for this mismatch one could either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When training is finished scale the final weight matrices $\\mathbf{W}^l, l=1,\\ldots,L$ by $p^{l-1}_d$ (remember, $p^{0}_d$ is the probability related to the input features)\n",
    "2. Scale the activations in equation (9) during training, that is, for each mini-batch multiply $\\mathbf{\\hat h}^l$ by $1/p^l_d$ to compensate for dropped units and then at run-time use the model as usual, **without** scaling. Make sure the $1/p^l_d$ scaler is taken into account for both forward and backward passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommendation is option 2 as it will make some things easier from implementation perspective. "

    "Implement dropout regularisation technique. Then for the same initial configuration as in Exercise 1. investigate effectivness of different dropout rates applied to input features and/or hidden layers. Start with $p_{inp}=0.5$ and $p_{hid}=0.5$ and do some search for better settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation tips:\n",
    "* Add a function `fprop_dropout` to `mlp.layers.MLP` class which (on top of `inputs` argument) takes also dropout-related argument(s) and perform dropout forward propagation through the model.\n",
    "* One also would have to introduce required modificastions to `mlp.optimisers.SGDOptimiser.train_epoch()` function.\n",
    "* Design and implemnt dropout scheduler in a similar way to how learning rates are handled (that is, allowing for some implementation dependent schedule which is kept independent of implementation in `mlp.optimisers.SGDOptimiser.train()`). \n",
    "   +  For this exercise implement only fixed dropout scheduler - `DropoutFixed`, but implementation should allow to easily add other schedules in the future. \n",
    "   +  Dropout scheduler of any type should return a tuple of two numbers $(p_{inp},\\; p_{hid})$, the first one is dropout factor for input features (data-points), and the latter dropout factor for hidden layers (assumed the same for all hidden layers)."
